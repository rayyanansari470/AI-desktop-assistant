# AI-desktop-assistant
This is an amazing voice activated desktop assistant that can perform different actions for you like talking, opening browser and apps, and playing music, videos etc. I will upgrade it from time to time to add more functions and will upload the code for both windows and linux. Make shure to download modules mentioned or use a virtual environment.
